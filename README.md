# Blogless

The platform for bloggers who never wanted a blogging platform in the first place.

## Why would I want it?

Blogless is for writing, not for reading. Readers interact with your website, which serves content you wrote on Blogless. This enables you to completely control the user experience, without building your own infrastructure, or messing about with deploying static content for every new post.

## Who will this be for?

Firstly, it's for me: I want to use a CDN to serve my blog, but I don't want to write code whenever I write a new post.

- designers who are savvy with HTML/CSS
- devs with better things to do that build the features Blogless
- anyone willing to go through some basic technical setup to avoid giving all your traffic to a blogging platform

## My vision for the workflow

### Easy Installation

1.  create a free account
1.  write first post
1.  use Github to fork a Blogless template
1.  copy settings to the config file of their forked template
1.  enable Github pages, and navigate to `<username>.github.io/<repo>` to view their first post
1.  edit HTML/CSS of template to their taste

### Other options

1.  build your own template

- from scratch
- using a boiler plate (a node package to create this would be cool)

1.  Literally anything you like, it's an API after all

# Is it ready yet?

No. In fact, I'm surprised you're reading this. I've barely started. If you like the vision and want to see it happen sooner, reach out to me to see how you can help. Or just give me a star. Stars are nice too.
